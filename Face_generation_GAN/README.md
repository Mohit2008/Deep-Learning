# Face Generation
In this project, you'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.
### Get the Data
You'll be using two datasets in this project:
- MNIST
- CelebA

Since the celebA dataset is complex and you're doing GANs in a project for the first time, we want you to test your neural network on MNIST before CelebA.  Running the GANs on MNIST will allow you to see how well your model trains sooner.
